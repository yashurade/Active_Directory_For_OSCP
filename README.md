# Active Directory Methodology for OSCP and Beyond

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Yash Urade. I recently passed the OSCP exam this April, and I'm excited to share my methodology for Active Directory. Active Directory (AD) is the backbone of many enterprise networks, and understanding its intricacies is crucial for any cybersecurity professional. This my methodology and how I started with Active Directory, I'll walk you through the fundamentals of Active Directory, techniques for enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, Attacks to remember and some defense stuff. Let's dive in!

## Active Directory Fundamentals

## What is Active Directory?

Active Directory is a centralized database used for managing users, passwords, computers, servers, and other resources across a network. Key components include:

- **Domains**: Logical groupings of network objects with a common security boundary.
  
- **Forests**: Collections of one or more domains sharing a common schema, configuration, and global catalog.

- **Domain Controllers**: Servers responsible for authenticating users and maintaining the AD database.

- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: Protocol for accessing and managing directory data.

- **Kerberos**: Network authentication protocol providing secure authentication between clients and servers. For a detailed explanation of Kerberos, check out this video: [Understanding Kerberos Authentication](https://youtu.be/snGeZlDQL2Q?si=JDWBcWTB-Z-qN4CD) by vbscrub.

- **SMB (Server Message Block)**: Network file sharing protocol used for accessing shared resources.


## Enumeration

Enumeration is the process of gathering information about an Active Directory environment. This phase is crucial for understanding the network topology, identifying potential attack vectors, and planning the next steps of the engagement. We'll explore tools and techniques for enumerating domains, domain controllers, users, groups, and computers.

## Exploitation

With information gathered during the enumeration phase, we can now identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses within the Active Directory environment. This includes exploiting misconfigured permissions, weak passwords, vulnerable services, and other common issues. We'll discuss various exploitation techniques and how to escalate privileges within an Active Directory environment.

## Post-Exploitation

Once we've gained initial access to the Active Directory environment, our goal is to maintain access, move laterally within the network, and establish persistence. Post-exploitation techniques such as pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, and lateral movement will be covered in this section. We'll also discuss methods for evading detection and covering our tracks.

## Defense and Mitigation

Finally, we'll explore best practices for defending Active Directory environments against attacks. This includes implementing least privilege, strong authentication mechanisms, and proper segmentation. We'll also discuss techniques for detecting and responding to Active Directory attacks, as well as tools that can aid in this process.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, understanding Active Directory is essential for any cybersecurity professional, whether you're preparing for the OSCP exam or seeking to enhance your skills in AD security. By following the methodology outlined in this guide, you'll gain the knowledge and techniques needed to navigate and secure Active Directory environments effectively.
